## Sign Up Flow

   - Once email is sent, server sends succes msg & emailVerification token & UI navigates to /verify-email?tkn=${res.emailVerificationToken}?from="sign" - [TODO] - On verify-email page anticipate the from param & render proper message
  
2. User checks his email, clicks on verification link which makes GET /verify-email?tkn=<emailToken> on the server which validates token & if valid redirects user to client on route "/email-verified?email={}" to show success message. 
    - [TODO] : Link to login should navigate to login with the email & prefill the email field with it
3. User can then proceed to login again

## Login Flow
