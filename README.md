# **🎬 FlickPick - Stop Debating, Start Watching**

**End the "what should we watch?" debate for good.**

FlickPick is a decision-making platform that helps friends, couples, and families choose movies together—without the endless group chat debates. We solve the coordination problem so you can focus on the fun part: actually watching.

## ** The Problem**

### **The Movie Night Planning Nightmare:**
-  **30+ minutes** lost debating in group chats
-  **No fair system** - someone always compromises
-  **Scheduling headaches** across time zones and busy lives
-  **Streaming confusion** - "Who has Netflix? Does anyone have Hulu?"
-  **Lost conversations** - Great discussions disappear in chat history

**Result:** Decision fatigue, frustration, or movie night never happens.

---

## ** The Solution**

FlickPick transforms chaotic planning into a **simple 4-step process:**

1. **Create** a group for your movie nights
2. **Suggest & Vote** on movies with fair voting (up/down + veto power)
3. **Schedule** a time that works for everyone
4. **Watch & Discuss** with post-movie ratings and conversations

**We don't stream movies—we help you decide which ones to watch.**
